caesar_salad,My mistress’ eyes are nothing like the sun; Coral is far more red than her lips’ red; If snow be white&, why then her breasts are dun; If hairs be wires&, black wires grow on her head. I have seen roses damasked&, red and white&, But no such roses see I in her cheeks; And in some perfumes is there more delight Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks. I love to hear her speak&, yet well I know That music hath a far more pleasing sound; I grant I never saw a goddess go; My mistress when she walks treads on the ground. And yet&, by heaven&, I think my love as rare As any she belied with false compare.,20/12/2009,likes:{},dislikes:{}
